# Classical Machine Learning (ML)  

While advanced models like Transformers and diffusion models dominate many AI headlines, classical machine learning (ML) remains highly effective in specific contexts where structured data and interpretability are priorities.

### Strengths  
Classical ML models  such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and boosting algorithms often excel with structured tabular data and smaller datasets, where deep learning may overfit or be less efficient. For example, ensemble methods like XGBoost and LightGBM are frequently top performers on tabular classification and regression tasks and are easier to optimize in resource-constrained environments. These models also tend to require less compute and can be more interpretable than deep learning counterparts, which aids debugging and compliance. Classic methods often rely on manual feature engineering, a significant difference from the end-to-end learning of modern deep models.

### Use Cases  
Classical ML is widely used in domains where interpretability, reliability, and computational efficiency are paramount, such as fraud detection systems, production quality monitoring, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, risk assessment, and structured business metrics forecasting. These models also power many traditional analytics pipelines and remain industry staples for tabular problems where simpler models outperform larger architectures. 

### Limitations  
Despite their strengths, classical ML models struggle with high-dimensional unstructured data such as raw text or images, where they typically require extensive feature extraction and preprocessing. They also generally underperform compared with deep learning architectures on problems involving complex patterns or large-scale representation learning.
