# AI Beyond LLMs: A Research-to-Product Guide for Modern Intelligent Systems (FINAL DOCUMENT)

## Project Title
**AI Beyond LLMs: A Research-to-Product Guide for Modern Intelligent Systems**

---

## Project Description
This article aims to become a **flagship technical asset** for the club: a guide that unifies:

- Research foundations  
- Modern AI system design  
- Engineering pipelines  
- Deployment and productization  

The article will describe the **full lifecycle of an AI system**, not only classic ML, but also modern architectures such as:

- Transformers  
- Diffusion models  
- Multimodal models  
- Retrieval-augmented systems  
- Agents  
- Embeddings  

**Goals for the document:**

- Academically rigorous  
- Engineering-oriented  
- Aligned with current industry standards  
- Credible to any senior AI/ML engineer
